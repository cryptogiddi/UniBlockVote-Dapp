# UniBlockVote-Dapp
Institutional Voting on top of Ethereum Blockchain
This is an online decentralized voting application (DAPP) that implements the blockchain technology. By decentralization, it means that the data cannot be tampered with which brings about transparency in any voting process: opposed to the database being maintained by a single organization and having complete control of the database, including the ability to tamper with the stored data, or add data fraudulently.
Blockchain voting is similar to analogue voting, the same concepts and processes apply. In order to cast a digital vote, one must be eligible in any voting process, be it in opinion polls beauty pageants, university voting, company voting, Micro saving groups etc the identity is recorded on the Blockchain associated with that user’s key. Ballots are required to cast a vote, in Blockchain, this will take the form of a special voting token deposited in a users account. The token will have a time limit in which it is valid after which it will burn itself via a smart contract or it’s rendered useless.
